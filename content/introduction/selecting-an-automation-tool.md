# Which tool should you use?

- Criteria to use:
  - Skillset of the Technology Team
  - Budget (opt for open source tools first)
  - If looking at paid tools, does it have a free trial you can use?
  - Does it complement your code base? (If your code base is in JavaScript, best to use JS frameworks)
  - Does it fit to your testing needs?
  - Is there a lot of online support or community?
  - Does it integrate with other testing frameworks easily?

~~~SECTION:notes~~~

Skillset - Use tools that everyone is familiar with. No point using Python or Ruby frameworks if everyone is familar with Java or JavaScript.

Budget - Most tools are open source (e.g. selenium, cypress)

Code base - Speak the same language as your developers. This will be easier in the future if developers also need to write tests apart from unit and integration.

Choose a tool that fits with your requirements.

StackOverflow support, Good API documentation
