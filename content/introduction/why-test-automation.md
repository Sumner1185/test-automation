# Why Test Automation?

- Fast feedback loop whenever we find issues in our code
- Save us time in doing repetitive manual regression tests
- Tests can be executed as part of the CI pipeline
- Tests can be run concurrently
- Wider selection of test devices and browsers
- Testers can focus on other work
- Can execute tests that are difficult to do manually (e.g. load testing)
