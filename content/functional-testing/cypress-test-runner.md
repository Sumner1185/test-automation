- Test status menu - see how many tests pass or failed and how long the tests run.
- URL preview - URL of your application
- Viewport sizing - The dimensions to which your application is tested against. 
- Command log - each action that you performed as well as useful logs.
- App preview - Shows a preview of your application and how it behaves when being tested.


# Selector Playground
